The molecular structures must be encoded into a representation that is suitable to be used as input to a Machine Learning model.
We experimented with three such representations: 
1) Pharmacophore </br>
2) Morgan </br>
3) Graph fingerprints </br>

We achieved the best performance with Pharmacophore and Morgan representations, so we give specific attention to models using these representations in this paper.
